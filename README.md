# Coral Bleaching Explorable Explanation
This explorable explanation shows the trends of coral bleaching while explaning the drastic effects that bleaching can have on a marine ecosystem. By allowing this explanation to be interactive based on the users inputs, the user can better remember and understand the data that they are viewing since they can change various parameters while interacting with the data.

## Design
Using data visualization skills, we created a website that allows viewers to read a brief intro about coral bleaching while seeing visualizations of pieces of coral indicating their bleaching severity. As they scroll further down, they will see a map showing where bleaching is the most serve so viewers can understand at a broad scope where this bleaching is happening (not just in the Great Barrier Reef!). After that, users can see the health trends of coral reefs to visualize how healthy coral are declining while bleached ones are increasing. Once users have learned about the effects of coral bleaching, they can interact with a coral bleaching simulation to understand how bleaching can spread and hurt marine wildlife that share the same ecosystem.

## Contribution
Created by Alexis Koss and Lisa Koss. Both of us worked on the interactive map showing where bleaching is the most severe, the trend line graph, as well as the interactive coral bleaching simulation graph to represent data to the viewers of our explanation.

## Installation Instructions
To run this explorable explanation, open up a new terminal window and clone the GitHub repo. Then **cd** into **explorable-visualization** folder located on your computer. 

Before you start a server, you must run the command: **npm install**
*(you must install the additional node modules or the application will not run properly; these are required dependencies)* 

Then start a python server (or any other suitable server if you wish) with the following command: **python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888** and navigate to **localhost:8888** on your web browser.
