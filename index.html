    <h1>Coral Reefs</h1>
    <h2>Are Slowly Disappearing</h2>
    <p>Global warming isn’t just warming surface temperatures around the world, it’s also harming our reefs as ocean water temperatures
      rise higher and higher every year. Find out what it means for the economy, the ecosystem, and local marine life.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px">Numerous things can cause coral bleaching to occur, including small changes in ocean temperatures (colder temperatures
      affect coral too!), runoff and pollution, overexposure to sunlight, and extreme low tides (<a href="https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/climate-change-threat-to-reef">source</a>). Mostly driven by climate change, sea surface temperatures are rising each year and even just a small increase
      of 1 °C can cause global bleaching events to occur (<a href=“http://time.com/coral/“>source</a>). The longer a bleaching event lasts, the chance for a reef to recovery rapidly diminishes.</p>
    <p>Both coral and algae, called zooxanthellae, depend on each other to live. Without the algae, the coral cannot prosper
      and will lose it’s distinctive color. When the coral begins to be stressed, the algae will be expelled from the coral,
      usually due to rising water temperatures the coral cannot withstand.</p>
    <p>When this happens, it is believed that coral programmatically kill some of their weaker cells, so they have a chance
      for recovery later when the bleaching event is over (<a href="https://www.simplyscuba.com/blogs/blog/why-corals-die-from-stress-in-warmer-oceans">source</a>). As soon as the algae are absent from the coral for long periods of time, the entire coral will start to
      turn white and very pale because it’s major food source is missing.</p>

    <p>If the bleaching event lasts too long, a coral will have no chance to recover. A bleached coral is not only very susceptible
      to disease, but it is also starving while the algae are expelled. Once a coral is under stress for too long of a time
      period, it will die and turn a brown, black color since the coral’s tissues have disappeared and algae have reappeared
      to use the dead coral as a host (<a href=“https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/climate-change-threat-to-reef”>source</a>).</p>
    <p>It only takes a few weeks for coral to become bleached, but can take months for an entire reef to recover back to its
      original, healthy state. No doubt, some rate of mortality will be seen as coral try to recover during their bleaching
      stage.</p>

    <h3>Bleaching Event History</h3>
    <p>Over the last few decades, many coral bleaching events have occurred worldwide, causing severe damage. Most notably, there were bleaching events during 1998, 2002, and 2005 due to higher than average summer sea surface temperatures.</p>
    <p>The map shows reports of coral bleaching from <strong>1983</strong> throughout <strong>2010</strong>. You can hover over each data point for more information and you can also pan and zoom on the map.</p>
    <div id="coral-map-slider" class="content-container"></div>
    <h2 style="clear: both">1998</h2>
    <p>During the
      <a href="javascript:linkUpdate(1998)">1998 coral bleaching event</a> in the summer, it was recorded as one of the hottest on record for coral reefs during
      the 20th century. A survey of over 650 reefs showed that nearly 1/2 of them experienced moderate to high levels of
      bleaching. Fortunately, most reefs recovered, with only a small percentage of coral deaths (mostly in the Palm Island
      area). </p>
    <h2>2002</h2>
    <p>Fortunately, during the
      <a href="javascript:linkUpdate(2002)">2002 coral bleaching event</a>, it was only slightly more severe than the one witnessed in 1998. The biggest signs
      of bleaching were noticed in early 2002, but by the end of April, most reefs had recovered. NOAA observed around 54%
      of the nearly 650 reefs surveyed showed moderate to high levels of bleaching, similar to the 1998 event. Less than
      5% of reefs suffered a high amount of deaths.</p>
    <h2>2005</h2>
    <p>In the
      <a href="javascript:linkUpdate(2005)">2005 coral bleaching event</a>, the bleaching was mostly localized to one area. However, despite being confined to
      the Keppel Islands, up to 98% of corals were bleached on the surrounding reefs, resulting in 30%+ coral deaths.</p>

    <h2>Beyond The Data</h2>
    <p>Beyond the dataset shown across these two charts, there is a massive bleaching event currently going on from the year
      of
      <strong>2016.</strong> NOAA has declared this a global bleaching event due to record breaking ocean temperatures around the
      world. Due to the extent of the bleaching event, corals have had almost no time for recovery and reefs are rapidly
      declining. Because bleaching events are occuring so often in the last few years, the future is bleak for reefs if action is not
      taken immediately.</p>

      <p>After reading about coral bleaching, you can now use the following simulator to simulate how coral bleaching takes place in the ocean that surrounds us. What happens if the temperature gets too hot? Too cold? What if the tide gets too low, what happens to the coral then? Find out below!</p>

      <h5>What Life is Like</h5>
      <p>This simulator demonstrates what life is like for coral in differing ocean conditions. When corals become stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, tide level, or sunlight, they begin to expel the zooxanthellae algae in their tissues. When all of this algae has disappeared, the coral becomes completely bleached and vulnerable to disease. </p>
      <p>Although, even if a bleaching event occurs, there is still a chance of recovery if the stress-caused bleaching is not severe. Unfortunately though, if the loss of algae is prolonged and the stress continues without a chance for the zooxanthellae to return to the coral's tissues, the coral will eventually die <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html">(source)</a>.</p>

      <h5>The Ocean's Temperature</h5>
      <p>The types of water that corals live in is very small as coral reefs are generally confined to tropical and semi-tropical waters due to very strict environmental restrictions. The temperature within these waters plays an additional role in how well coral thrive and grow <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralwaters.html">(source)</a>.</p>
